The demand for large-scale, low-cost precision machining using Computer Numerical Control (CNC) has risen in recent years as advanced processes become more commonplace in the manufacturing industry. For example, the precision machining of tungsten for use in fusion reactors is one such application where tool health monitoring is crucial, as the machining of hard materials such as tungsten is characterised by short tool life, necessitating frequent tool changes to avoid failures and potential damage to the workpiece--tools are often discarded before prematurely leading to high manufacturing and environmental costs.

, particularly, the use of Computer Numerically Controlled drilling
